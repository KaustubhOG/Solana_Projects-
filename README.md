# 🔗 Solana Projects — Beginner to Advanced

A structured collection of Solana smart contracts built with **Rust** and the **Anchor framework**, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced DeFi and NFT protocols.

>  **Goal:** To document a hands-on learning journey through Solana development — every project reflects a step up in complexity and real-world application.
